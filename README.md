## About This Repository
This repository showcases my solutions to a variety of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems developed as part of my coursework.  
Each solution is carefully implemented, tested, and documented to demonstrate both **correctness** and **efficiency**.  

The repository is organized with **separate folders for each problem**, including:  
- Problem description and link  
- Solution code in C++  
- Explanation of the approach  
- Screenshots or proof of successful submissions  

## What I Did
- Tackled problems across core DSA topics such as **arrays, circular queues, linked lists, stacks, trees, sorting algorithms, and recursion**.  
- Wrote all solutions in **C++**, including detailed comments to explain logic and reasoning.  
- Verified solutions through screenshots and submission proofs.  
- Maintained a structured folder system, keeping **problem statements, solutions, and explanations** together for clarity.  

## What I Learned
- Gained a stronger understanding of **fundamental data structures** and their practical applications.  
- Practiced implementing **optimized algorithms**, such as circular queues, binary search variations, and in-place array operations.  
- Improved coding practices for **readable, maintainable, and well-documented code**.  
- Sharpened problem-solving skills, including **breaking down complex problems** and managing edge cases.  


## Challenges Faced
- Handling **edge cases** and ensuring **robust recursive implementations**.  
- Implementing **in-place algorithms** efficiently without additional memory.  
- Balancing **time complexity and readability** in each solution.  
- Translating problem statements into **working C++ code** while meeting constraints.  

## Future Directions
- Add more advanced problems involving **graphs, heaps, tries, and dynamic programming**.  
- Include **visual demonstrations** of algorithms for better conceptual understanding.  
- Explore **real-world applications** of data structures in simulations, scheduling, and system design.
